Before runing script :
1. Ensure sqlite databse is inside the /database directory
2. Virtual environment with all dependencies installed have been created. See SETUP below

# SETUP / FIRST RUN
1. Clone repository
2. Create a virtual environment(env) inside repository folder ("aws data processing"), using a terminal:
    windows: python -m venv env
    linux: python3 venv env

3. Enter virtual environment:
    windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
    linux: source env/bin/activate

4. Install the dependencies in the virtual env using Pip:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run Script:
